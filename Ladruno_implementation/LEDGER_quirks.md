# Ledger — OpenSees quirks & gotchas we learned

Surprising, undocumented, or bug-prone behaviours of upstream OpenSees that
cost us time. Recording them here so we (and future us) stop re-discovering
them. This is observation-only — fixes we actually applied are tracked in
[[LEDGER_vanilla_files]] / [[LEDGER_implementations]].

## Conventions

- **One section per quirk.** Title = the symptom you'd search for.
- State: *what bites*, *why*, *workaround/status*, and the *date* learned.
- If a quirk drove a code change, cross-link the ledger row / PR.
- Deep build/toolchain quirks may live in
  [[../Ladruno_internal/01_compilation_journal]]; link rather than duplicate.

## Quirks

### MPCORecorder `exit(-1)` kills the kernel
- **Bites:** ~25 raw libc `exit(-1)` calls in upstream `MPCORecorder.cpp` hard-kill
  the Jupyter kernel on any recorder error and leave the `.mpco` unflushed.
- **Why:** upstream uses `exit()` for error handling; no exception path. The file
  has been byte-identical to `master` and frozen ~4.5 years.
- **Status:** diagnose-only as of 2026-05-18. A local `ladruno` patch is the only
  fix; deferred. The `MPCO_Ladruno` rewrite (`mpcol`) avoids the pattern.

### `patch_banner.py` path went stale after workspace consolidation
- **Bites:** `patch_banner.py` computed `TARGET = ROOT/OpenSees/SRC/...`, assuming an
  inner `OpenSees/` dir. After the 2026-05-30 consolidation `SRC/` sits directly
  under the repo root, so the script silently targeted a non-existent path.
- **Why:** the script predated moving the workspace into the repo root.
- **Status:** **fixed** — paths recomputed to `ROOT/SRC/...`; the script now also
  patches the feature list into both `tclMain.cpp` and `PythonModule.cpp`.

### MPCO is nodal-blind without an element-result parity gate
- **Bites:** a recorder can pass all *nodal* parity checks yet silently drop or
  mis-tag *element/material* results (e.g. Lagrange quad/tri `setResponse` tags).
- **Why:** nodal and element result paths are independent; testing one doesn't
  cover the other.
- **Status:** addressed by the element-result parity gate ([#14](https://github.com/nmorabowen/OpenSees/pull/14)) and the upstream `setResponse` fix ([#7](https://github.com/nmorabowen/OpenSees/pull/7)).

### Damping shrinks the explicit critical time step — and βK is a trap
- **Bites:** adding damping *reduces* `dt_cr` in both coupled and explicit modes;
  stiffness-proportional damping (`βK`) is especially punishing under explicit
  integration.
- **Why:** βK inflates the effective high-frequency content that sets `dt_cr`.
- **Status:** use mass-proportional (`αM`) damping in explicit; captured in the
  CentralDifferenceLadruno plan (`project_robust_central_difference`).

### `partition` needs the METIS 5 API (Patch 9)
- **Bites:** the openseespy `partition` command fails / mislinks without the
  METIS 5 API path.
- **Why:** upstream assumes an older METIS; the MP build links METIS 5.
- **Status:** guarded with a clear error message in `OpenSeesMiscCommands.cpp`
  ([#1](https://github.com/nmorabowen/OpenSees/pull/1)); `OPS_HAVE_METIS5` follow-up noted.

### `openseessp` is an unbuilt subsystem (Python has no SP)
- **Bites:** expecting an `import openseessp` analogous to `openseesmp`.
- **Why:** the SP parallel engine exists only on the Tcl side; the Python engine
  never had an SP build. Its build trace was fully removed from the fork.
- **Status:** by design — use `openseesmp`. Rationale in `02_openseespymp.md`.
