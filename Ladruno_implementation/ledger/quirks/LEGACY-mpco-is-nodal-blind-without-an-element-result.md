### MPCO is nodal-blind without an element-result parity gate
- **Bites:** a recorder can pass all *nodal* parity checks yet silently drop or
  mis-tag *element/material* results (e.g. Lagrange quad/tri `setResponse` tags).
- **Why:** nodal and element result paths are independent; testing one doesn't
  cover the other.
- **Status:** addressed by the element-result parity gate ([#14](https://github.com/nmorabowen/OpenSees/pull/14)) and the upstream `setResponse` fix ([#7](https://github.com/nmorabowen/OpenSees/pull/7)).
